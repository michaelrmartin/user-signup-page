## About The Project

<br><br>This site should:
<br>1. Display a form with inputs for "Name", "Email", "Password", "Occupation", and "State".
<br>2. "Occupation" and "State" should allow users to select from options returned by an endpoint. Users should only be able to select one occupation and one state.
<br>3. Not allow form submission without completing the entire form.
<br>4. Provide feedback upon successful form submission.
